# 📘 AutoVersion — Pro / Future Feature Preview

This document describes **features that are NOT part of AutoVersion Lite**,  
and are implemented in *other future Solcogito versioning tools*.

These features DO NOT belong to Lite or Pro of AutoVersion — they are for a different program (as clarified by the project owner).

Every section below is provided **for archival reference only**.

# ❗ IMPORTANT
These capabilities are **not part of AutoVersion Lite 1.1.x**,
